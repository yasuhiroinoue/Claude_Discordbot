## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer.
- A Google Cloud account and project setup for VertexAI.
- A Discord bot token.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**

   Install the Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Additionally, install the `anthropic[vertex]` package for VertexAI integration:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -U 'anthropic[vertex]'
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the necessary environment variables:

   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<Your Discord Bot Token>
   MAX_HISTORY=<Maximum Number of Messages to Remember>
   GCP_REGION=<Google Cloud Platform Region>
   GCP_PROJECT_ID=<Your GCP Project ID>
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual information.

4. **Run the Bot**

   With the setup complete, you can start the bot using:

   ```bash
   python ClaudeDiscordBot.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will listen for messages in all the servers it has been added to. Users can interact with the bot by mentioning it in a message or sending a direct message. The bot can process both text and images, providing responses generated by Claude-3.

## Customization

Modify the `.env` file to change environmental settings such as the Discord bot token, maximum message history, and Google Cloud configurations. The code itself can be customized to alter the bot's behavior, command prefixes, and more.
